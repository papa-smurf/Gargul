# No Auto-Staging During Inspection

When the user asks you to **lint**, **check**, **inspect**, **verify**, or **review** code, do NOT automatically stage any changes you make.

## Wait for Explicit Instructions

Only stage changes (`git add`) when:
- The user explicitly asks you to stage them
- The user asks you to commit (staging is part of the commit workflow)
- You're making changes as part of an implementation task (not an inspection task)

## Inspection Tasks Include

- "lint this file"
- "check if this is correct"
- "verify the staged changes"
- "inspect for bugs"
- "review the code"
- "fix any linting errors"

## Implementation Tasks (OK to stage)

- "refactor this function"
- "implement feature X"
- "fix this bug" (when explicitly fixing, not just finding)
- User explicitly says "and stage it" or "commit these changes"

## Rationale

During inspection, the user wants to:
1. See what you found
2. Review your fixes
3. Decide whether to keep them

Auto-staging removes this control and can clutter the git state during exploratory work.
