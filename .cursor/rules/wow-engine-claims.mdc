# WoW Engine & Client Behavior Claims

When describing WoW client behavior that cannot be verified by reading the codebase or linked documentation, **flag your confidence level**.

## What counts as "engine behavior"

- Addon loading mechanics (discovery, load order, taint)
- Frame rendering details (backdrop timing, draw layers, texture thresholds)
- API quirks not documented on warcraft.wiki.gg
- SavedVariables serialization behavior
- Combat lockdown / protected-frame specifics
- Client performance characteristics

## Required format

When making such a claim, add one of:

- **(verified)** — you confirmed it from code in this repo, warcraft.wiki.gg, or wow-ui-source
- **(from memory, unverified)** — you believe this is correct but have not checked a source

## Rules

1. Never present unverified engine claims as fact. Always tag them.
2. If the claim is central to a decision (e.g. "WoW scans subdirectories for .toc files"), verify it first via `WebSearch` or `WebFetch` against warcraft.wiki.gg before stating it.
3. If you cannot verify, say so and suggest the user test in-game.
4. Do NOT pad uncertainty with filler like "I think" or "I believe" — use the tags above so they're scannable.
